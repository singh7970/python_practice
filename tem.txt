I hope this email finds you well. I recently visited your website and wanted to provide some feedback on a few aspects that might improve the overall user experience:

Layout Shifting Issue:

Noticed a layout shifting issue on the website, particularly when navigating between pages. Consistency in layout would enhance user navigation.
Non-Responsive Links:

Encountered unresponsive links on certain pages. Ensuring all links are functional is crucial for a seamless user experience.
Mobile Contact Section Placement:

Suggest relocating the contact section to the bottom for better accessibility and a more user-friendly experience on smartphones.
SSL Certificate Trust:

Consider updating the SSL certificate to instill trust in users. A secure connection is paramount for user confidence and data protection.
Optimization for Faster Loading:

Currently, all content loads simultaneously, potentially increasing the time for users to view the first page. Consider optimizing content loading for a faster and smoother experience.
